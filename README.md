## Usage

The book REST API exposes the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/books`: Get all books.
- `GET /api/books/{id}`: Get a book by its ID.
- `POST /api/books`: Create a new book.
- `PUT /api/books/{id}`: Update existing book information.
- `DELETE /api/books/{id}`: Delete a book by its ID.

You can use tools such as Postman or cURL to send HTTP requests to these endpoints.
